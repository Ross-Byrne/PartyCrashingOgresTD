# Overview

In Party Crashing Ogres Tower Defence, the ogres found out about your Castle Party and are coming to crash it!

All graphical assets featured in the game were created by myself, unless stated otherwise (see references).
The the game saves high scores to a leader board, and once a game is over, you can share your score to Twitter.

There are 5 different Enemy types (All with their party hats!).
There are 5 different Defence Towers.
And guess what? 5 different Waves, each getting harder in difficulty.

The start menu has 3 different sound tracks that play, and the main game has 5 different tracks. All tracks for each part of the game are randomly cycled through and faded in and out between.
To see audio credits, find "References" at the end of the README.
